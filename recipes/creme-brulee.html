    <li>Bring a couple of inches of water to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat; set the bowl with cream mixture over the saucepan to form a double boiler. Cook, gently stirring with a wooden spoon, until cream mixture thickens enoough to easily coat the back of the spoon.</li>

    <li>Chill in the refigerator for 2 hours.</li>
    <li>To make the topping: Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 incehs from the heat source. Combine 2 tablespoons white sugar and brown sugar in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over cold crème brûlée.</li>
    <li>Heat under the preheated broiler until sugar melts and browns, 2 to 3 minutes; return immediately to the refrigerator and chill until sugar is set, about 15 minutes.</li>
