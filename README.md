The Odin Recipes project is about a blog containing many of my favorite recipes.
The project contains an index or homepage and 3 recipe pages. The homepage contains relative links to the 3 recipe pagess.
Each of the recipe pages contain absolute hyperlinks to the their respective pages on the internet. This project will showcase my abilities to create a blog page containing ordred and unordered lists, hyperlinks, images, headers, and emphasized text.   # odin-recipes
